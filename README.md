# Portrait Pear Portfolio

Vue application for the Portrait Pear branded version of my portfolio. Supports searching for shoots, is mobile friendly, and supports native iOS. Caching and offline mode!

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### I'm Sorry

Look... you need to know that this project, while an important part of my photography branding, is never intended to scale. Is the code and documentation haphazard? Yes. Is there multiple ways of base64 encoding images for caching strewn about? Also yes. But it's serving its purpse, and it answered the questions that needed to be answered about using Capacitor and Tailwind as part of other project stacks. So, if you're reading this, I'm sorry it's not clean. Life is busy and there are other things to work on. It is what it is.
